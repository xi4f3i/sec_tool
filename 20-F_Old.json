        "We commenced operations through our predecessor,\nHimax Taiwan, in June 2001. We must, among other things, continue to expand and diversify our customer base, broaden our product\nportfolio, maintain our leading technology position, achieve additional design wins and manage our costs to partially mitigate\ndeclining average selling prices and any other market risks in order to maintain our profitability. Moreover, we must continue\nto address the challenges of being a growing technology company, including hiring and retaining managerial, engineering, operational\nand financial personnel and implementing and improving our existing administrative, financial and operations systems.",

        "We operate primarily in a fabless business\nmodel that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and assembly and testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering\nexpertise to design high-performance semiconductors and rely largely on third-party semiconductor manufacturing service providers\nfor wafer fabrication, gold bumping, assembly and testing with the exception of manufacturing of LCOS microdisplay and wafer level\noptics products, which we manufacture through our own factories. We are able to take advantage of the economies of scale and the\nspecialization of our third-party semiconductor manufacturing service providers. Our primarily fabless model enables us to capture\ncertain financial and operational benefits, including reduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures, fixed assets and\nfixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to use the technology and service providers that are the most suitable for any given\nproduct. For LCOS microdisplay and wafer level optics products, our in-house factories enable us to protect our proprietary technologies\nand manufacturing expertise in the effort to further expand these businesses.",

        "As our semiconductors are critical components\nof flat panel displays, our industry is closely linked to the trends and developments of the flat panel display industry, in particular,\nthe TFT-LCD panel segment. The majority of our revenues in 2016 were derived from sales of display drivers that were eventually\nincorporated into TFT-LCD panels. We expect display drivers for TFT-LCD panels to continue to be our primary products. The TFT-LCD\npanel industry is intensely competitive and is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of TFT-LCD\npanels could decline for numerous reasons, which could in turn result in downward pricing pressure on our products. See “Item\n3.D. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Business—We derive the majority\nof our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD panel industry, which is highly cyclical and subject to price fluctuations. Such\ncyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact our business or results of operations.” The revenue expansion\nof our non-driver products as well as TFT-LCD product trending toward high resolution and any other new product introduction help\nto mitigate these risks.",

        "Our performance is affected by the selling\nprices of each of our products. We price our products based on several factors, including manufacturing costs, life cycle stage\nof the product, competition, technical complexity of the product, size of the purchase order and our relationship with the customer.\nWe typically are able to charge the highest price for a product when it is first introduced. Although from time to time we are\nable to raise our selling prices during times of supply constraints, our average selling prices typically decline over a product’s\nlife cycle, which may be offset by changes in conditions in the semiconductor industry such as constraints in foundry capacity.\nThe general trend in the semiconductor industry is for the average selling prices of semiconductors to decline over a product’s\nlife cycle due to competition, production efficiencies, emergence of substitutes and technological obsolescence. Our cost reduction\nefforts also contribute to this decline in average selling prices. See “—Cost of Revenues and Cost Reductions.”",

        "From 2011 to 2014, smartphone and tablet\nboom across the world created impressive demand of TFT-LCD panels. The phenomenal smartphone market growth naturally invited intense\ncompetition in the driver IC space, especially in the lower-end segments, resulting in severe ASP pressure.\nIn the second half of 2015, over-supply issue happened to the large-sized TFT-LCD panel industry again. As high inventory\nlevel was built up in the first half of 2015 along with new capacity ramp from China panel makers, ASP pressure became intense\nas a result. In the first half of 2016, our large-sized display drivers suffered from another\nASP erosion due to the oversupply in large-sized TFT-LCD panel industry. In addition, our\naverage selling prices are affected by the size and bargaining power of our customers. The merger of CMO, the predecessor of Innolux\nand TPO could negatively affect our ability to maintain, if not raise, our selling prices. In addition, as new China panel makers\nemerge in the marketplace and continue to expand their capacity, China panel makers’ bargaining power will increase accordingly,\nnegatively impacting our average selling price. Our average selling prices are also affected by the packaging type our customers\nchoose as well as the level of product integration. See “—Product Mix” below. Lastly, competition level affects\nour average selling prices as well. For example, as competitors have started to enter into the smartphone driver IC space and\ncompete aggressively to get market share since the second quarter of 2012, average selling prices of smartphone driver IC for\nmid to low-end resolution have been under pressure since then. However, the impact of declining average selling prices on our\nprofitability might be offset or mitigated to a certain extent by increased volume as lower prices may stimulate demand and thereby\ndrive sales and TFT-LCD panel products trending toward higher resolution which creates a higher barrier of entry, less competition\nand higher profit margins.",

        "Unit Shipments",
        " ",
        "Our performance is also affected by the\nnumber of semiconductors we ship, or unit shipments. As our display drivers are critical components of flat panel displays, our\nunit shipments depend primarily on our customers’ panel shipments among other factors. Our unit shipments have grown since\nour inception primarily as a result of our increased market share with certain major customers and their increased shipments of\npanels. Our growth in unit shipments also reflected the demand for higher resolution panels which typically require more display\ndrivers. However, the development of higher channel display drivers or new technologies, if successful, could potentially reduce\nthe number of display drivers required for each panel while achieving the same resolution. If such technologies become commercially\navailable, the market for our display drivers will be reduced and we could experience a decline in revenue and profit.",

        "Product Mix",
        " ",
        "The proportion of our revenues that is\ngenerated from the sale of different product types, also referred to as product mix, also affects our average selling prices,\nrevenues and profitability. Our display driver products vary depending on, among other things, the number of output channels,\nthe level of integration and the package type. Variations in each of these specifications could affect the average selling prices\nof such products. For example, the trend for display drivers for use in large-sized panels is toward products with a higher number\nof channels, which typically command higher average selling prices than traditional products with a lower number of channels.\nHowever, panels that use higher-channel display drivers typically require fewer display drivers per panel. As a result, our profitability\nwill be adversely affected to the extent that the decrease in the number of display drivers required for each panel is not offset\nby increased total unit shipments and/or higher average selling prices for display drivers with a higher number of channels. The\nlevel of integration of our display drivers also affects average selling prices, as more highly integrated chips typically have\nhigher selling prices. Additionally, average selling prices are affected by changes in the package types used by our customers.\nFor example, the chip-on-glass package type typically has lower material costs because no processed tape is required. Moreover,\nour different non-driver products vary in average selling prices and costs.",
        " ",
        "The proportion of non-driver business\nwould also affect our financial position and results of operations. For the past three years, we have experienced operating losses\nfrom our non-driver business. This was partly due to low sales volume during these periods that led to insufficient revenue to\nfully cover expenses such as research and development and operating expenses. We expect; however, to ramp up the volume production\nand sales of our non-driver products in the future and generate positive operation income from such non-driver products. In addition,\ngiven that our non-driver products have higher gross margins and higher growth potential than our driver products, we expect the\noverall profit margin across our product platform to improve.",

Our revenues generated\nfrom sales of each of display drivers for mobile handsets applications, display drivers for consumer electronics applications\nand other non-driver products increased in 2014, primarily due to our increased market share for certain products, the larger\nmarket size for certain applications and a wider market adoption for some non-driver products. However, in 2015, display drivers\nfor mobile handsets applications declined mainly due to our key Korean end-customer’s decision to substantially increase\nthe portion of AMOLED panels in their smartphone portfolio and the weak smartphone sales in China. In addition, in 2015, the decline\nof worldwide tablet market resulted in the revenue decrease of display drivers for consumer electronics application despite strong\ngrowth of display drivers for automotive applications.

        "We routinely review our long-lived assets\nthat are held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not\nbe recoverable. The determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from\nthe use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The estimate of cash flows is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions\nabout expected future operating performance, average selling prices, utilization rates and other factors. If the sum of the undiscounted\ncash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying\nvalue of the asset exceeds its fair value, based on the best information available, including discounted cash flow analysis. However,\ndue to the cyclical nature of our industry and changes in our business strategy, market requirements, or the needs of our customers,\nwe may not always be in a position to accurately anticipate declines in the utility of our equipment or acquired technology until\nthey occur. Although we have the recurring losses in non-Driver product segment, we remain positive on the long-term prospect\nof our non-Driver product segment, judging by the expanding customer list that covers some of the world’s biggest tech names,\nand the busy engineering activities going on with such customers. Prior to evaluating goodwill for impairment, we evaluated the\nCompany’s long-lived assets for impairment. For CMOS image sensors and Projection displays these two asset groups, we determined\nthat the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset groups significantly exceeded their respective carrying\namounts. The undiscounted expected cash flows significantly exceeded the carrying amounts for CMOS image sensors asset group as\nof December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized\nfor any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.

        "In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), regarding the accounting for and disclosures of revenue recognition,\nwith an effective date for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. This update provides a single comprehensive\nmodel for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The model requires that revenue recognized reflect the actual\nconsideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services defined in the contract, including\nin situations with multiple performance obligations. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date, of the previously issued revenue\nrecognition guidance, by one year. The guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,\n2017. The guidance permits companies to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply\nthe requirements in the year of adoption, through cumulative adjustment. The Company has evaluated the effect ASU 2014-09 will\nhave on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect the new standard to have a material effect on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.",

        "\n·Display\n                                         Driver. The display driver receives image data from the timing controller and delivers\n                                         precise analog voltages or currents to create images on the display. The two main types\n                                         of display drivers for a TFT-LCD panel are gate drivers and source drivers. Gate drivers\n                                         turn on the transistor within each pixel cell on the horizontal line on the panel for\n                                         data input at each row. Source drivers receive image data from the timing controller\n                                         and generate voltage that is applied to the liquid crystal within each pixel cell on\n                                         the vertical line on the panel for data input at each column. The combination determines\n                                         the colors generated by each pixel. Typically multiple gate drivers and source drivers\n                                         are installed separately on the panel. However, for certain small and medium-sized applications,\n                                         gate drivers and source drivers are integrated into a single chip due to space and cost\n                                         considerations. Large-sized panels typically have higher resolution and require more\n                                         display drivers than small and medium-sized panels.",

The timing controller also generates controlling signals for gate\n                                         and source drivers.

In recent years, TFT-LCD panel manufacturers,\nin particular Taiwan- , Korea- and China-based manufacturers, have invested or are planning to invest heavily to establish, construct\nand ramp up additional fab capacity. The capital intensive nature of the industry often results in TFT-LCD panel manufacturers\noperating at a high level of capacity utilization in order to reduce unit costs. This tends to create a temporary oversupply of\npanels, which reduces the average selling price of panels and puts pricing pressure on component companies including display driver\ncompanies. Moreover, the concentration of panel manufacturers permits major panel manufacturers to exert pricing pressure on display\ndriver companies such as us. The small number of panel manufacturers exacerbates this situation as display driver companies, in\naddition to seeking to expand their customer base, must also focus on winning a larger percentage of such customers’ display\ndriver requirements.",

Some display drivers require mixed-signal design\nsince they combine both analog and digital devices on a single semiconductor to process both analog signals and digital data.\nManufacturing display drivers require high-voltage CMOS process technology operating typically at 4.5 to 24 volts for source drivers\nand 10 to 50 volts for gate drivers, levels of voltage which are not standard in the semiconductor industry. For display drivers,\nthe driving voltage must be maintained under a very high degree of uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve using standard\nCMOS process technology. However, manufacturing display drivers does not require very small-geometry semiconductor processes.\nTypically, the manufacturing process for large panel display drivers require geometries between 0.11 micron and 1 micron because\nthe physical dimensions of a high-voltage device do not allow for the economical reduction in geometries below this range. We\nbelieve that there are a limited number of fabs with high-voltage CMOS process technology that are capable of high-volume manufacturing\nof display drivers.",

        "Manufacturing display drivers requires\ncertain assembly and testing technologies and equipment that are not standard for other semiconductors and are offered by a limited\nnumber of providers. The assembly of display drivers typically uses either tape-automated bonding, also known as TAB, or chip-on-glass,\nalso known as COG, technologies. Display drivers also require gold bumping, which is a process in which gold bumps are plated\nonto each wafer to connect the die and the processed tape, in the case of TAB packages, and the glass, in the case of COG packages.\nTAB may utilize tape carrier packages, also known as TCP, or chip on film, also known as COF. The type of assembly used depends\non the panel manufacturer’s design, which is influenced by panel size and application and is typically determined by the\npanel manufacturers. Display drivers for large-sized applications typically require TAB package types and, to a lesser extent,\nCOG package types, whereas display drivers for mobile handsets and consumer electronics products typically require COG packages.\nThe testing of display drivers also requires special testers that can support high-channel and high-voltage output semiconductors.\nSuch testers are not standard in the semiconductor industry.",

        "The manufacturing of display drivers is\na complex process and requires several manufacturing stages such as wafer fabrication, gold bumping, and assembly and testing,\nand the availability of materials such as the processed tape used in TAB packaging. We refer to these manufacturing stages and\nmaterial requirements collectively as the “supply chain.” Panel manufacturers typically operate at high levels of\ncapacity utilization and require a reliable supply of display drivers. A shortage of display drivers, or a disruption to this\nsupply, may disrupt panel manufacturers’ operations since replacement supplies may not be available on a timely basis or\nat all, given the customization of display drivers. As a result, a display driver company’s ability to deliver its products\non a timely basis at the quality and quantity required is critical to satisfying its existing customers and winning new ones.\nSuch supply chain management is particularly crucial to fabless display driver companies that do not have their own in-house manufacturing\ncapacity. In the case of display drivers, supply chain management is further complicated by the high-voltage CMOS process technology\nand the special assembly and testing requirements that are not standard in the semiconductor industry. Access to this capacity\nalso depends in part on display driver companies having received assurances of demand for their products since semiconductor manufacturing\nservice providers require credible demand forecasts before allocating capacity among customers and investing to expand their capacity\nto support growth.",

        "The small form factor of mobile handsets\nand certain consumer electronics products restricts the space for components. Small and medium-sized panel applications typically\nrequire one or more source drivers, one or more gate drivers and one timing controller, which can be installed as separate semiconductors\nor as an integrated single-chip driver. Customers are increasingly demanding higher levels of integration in order to manufacture\nmore compact panels, simplify the module assembly process and reduce unit costs. Display driver companies must be able to offer\nhighly integrated chips that combine the source driver, gate driver and timing controller, as well as semiconductors such as memory,\npower circuit and image processors, into a single chip. Due to the size restrictions and stringent power consumption constraints\nof such display drivers, single-chip drivers are complex to design. For large-sized panel applications, integration is both more\ndifficult to achieve and less important since size and weight are less of a priority. Lastly, as our TFT-LCD panel customers had\nturned to pure in-cell TDDI panel development for thinner display designs, we have developed a series of single chip touch display\ndriver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch display panel.",

Resolution refers to the number of pixels per line multiplied\n                                         by the number of lines, which determines the level of fine detail within an image displayed\n                                         on a panel. For example, a color display screen with 1,024 x 768 pixels has 1,024 red\n                                         columns, 1,024 green columns and 1,024 blue columns for a total of 3,072 columns and\n                                         768 rows. The red, green and blue columns are commonly referred to as “RGB.”\n                                         Therefore, the display drivers need to drive 3,072 column outputs and 768 row outputs.\n                                         The number of display drivers required for each panel depends on the resolution of the\n                                         panel and the number of channels per display driver. For example, an XGA (1,024 x 768\n                                         pixels) panel requires eight 384-channel source drivers (1,024 x 3 = 384 x 8) and three\n                                         256-channel gate drivers (768 = 256 x 3), while a full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) panel\n                                         requires eight 720-channel source drivers and four 270-channel gate drivers. The number\n                                         of display drivers required can be reduced by using drivers with a higher number of channels.\n                                         For example, a full HD panel can have six 960-channel source drivers instead of eight\n                                         720-channel source drivers. Thus, using display drivers with a higher number of channels\n                                         can reduce the number of display drivers required for each panel, although display drivers\n                                         with a higher number of channels typically have higher unit costs.",

Gate drivers\n                                         typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages ranging\n                                         from 10 to 50 volts. Lower input voltage saves power and lowers electromagnetic interference,\n                                         or EMI. Output voltage may be higher or lower depending on the characteristics of the\n                                         liquid crystal (or diode), in the case of source drivers, or TFT device, in the case\n                                         of gate drivers.",

        "\n·Gamma Curve.\n                                         The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied\n                                         to it by the source driver is nonlinear and is referred to as the “gamma curve”\n                                         of the source driver. Different panel designs and manufacturing processes require source\n                                         drivers with different gamma curves. Display drivers need to adjust the gamma curve to\n                                         fit the pixel design. Due to the materials and processes used in manufacturing, panels\n                                         may contain certain imperfections which can be corrected by the gamma curve of the source\n                                         driver, a process which is generally known as “gamma correction.” For certain\n                                         types of liquid crystal, the gamma curves for RGB cells are significantly different and\n                                         thus need to be independently corrected. Some advanced display drivers feature three\n                                         independent gamma curves for RGB cells.",

        "\n·Driver Interface.\n                                         Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and display\n                                         drivers. Display drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to\n                                         address the larger data volume necessary for video images. Panels used for higher data\n                                         transmission applications, such as televisions, require more advanced interface technology.\n                                         The principal types of interface technologies are transistor-to-transistor logic, or\n                                         TTL, reduced swing differential signaling, or RSDS, mini-low voltage differential signaling,\n                                         or mini-LVDS, and point-to-point high speed interface.

COF\n                                         and TCP are two types of TAB packages, of which COF packages have become predominantly\n                                         used in recent years.

For panel module applications, a power management IC provides a reliable and precise voltage for source drivers,\ngate drivers, timing controllers, and panel cells. Moreover, its built-in over-temperature and over-current protections help prevent\ncomponents from being damaged under certain abnormal conditions. As integrating an increasing number of components into a power\nmanagement IC is likely to be a continuing trend, we believe power management ICs will continue to be critical components of a\nTFT-LCD panel module.

The WiseEye can be used in different kinds of applications, including smart office, smart building,\nsurveillance, robotics, etc. In addition to developing the AoS product to drive the power as low as possible, we’re also\ndevoted ourselves in designing the industrial leading pixel with higher near infrared Quantum Efficiency (“QE”) to\nsupport the new generate 3D depth camera. 5MP UltraSense2 is our 1st product in NIR sensor product line\nwith QE over 40% in 850nm and around 25% in 940nm. Its superior performance hugely helps to lower the system power and enhances\nthe system performance. With the high QE in NIR band, we open the doors to building more sensor and camera systems for machine\nvision.

These new rules will\nrequire us to ascertain and disclose the origin of some of the raw materials that we use. Initial disclosures were required no\nlater than May 31, 2014, with subsequent disclosures required no later than May 31 of each following year. Currently, such conflict\nis not determinable in our case and we cannot assure you that no conflict minerals identified under the conflict minerals rules\nissued by the SEC are not used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the\norigins of these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedure that we implement, which may harm\nour reputation. In that event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of\nour products are certified as conflict mineral free. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements,\nincluding costs for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to\nproducts, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules and\nour compliance procedures could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As there\nmay be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able\nto obtain necessary “conflict free” minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.",
