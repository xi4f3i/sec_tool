        "\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Overview  ",
        "        Semiconductor chips, also known as integrated circuits, are used in personal computers, telecommunication equipment, digital consumer\nelectronics, wireless communication products and other applications. Types of semiconductor chips include memory chips (which store and retrieve information), microprocessors (logic devices which\nprocess information) and \"system on chip\" devices (which have both logic and memory features). Most semiconductor chips are built on a wafer of silicon of either 200mm (8 inches) or 300mm (12 inches)\nin diameter. Each semiconductor chip is made up of millions of tiny transistors or \"switches\" to control the functions of the device. Transistors are created in the silicon wafer by introducing\nvarious precisely placed impurities into the silicon in specific patterns. The process steps in the formation of transistors are traditionally referred to as \"front-end-of-line.\" The\n\"back-end-of-line\" process steps connect the transistors and other components together through several overlapping layers of metal wires, known as interconnect, creating a complete circuit. Each layer\nof metal interconnect must be separated by a non-conductive or insulating material called inter-level dielectric. Each layer that is added is selectively patterned to all previous layers through a\nprocess called photolithography. ",
        "        Semiconductor\nchip manufacturers utilize many different types of equipment in the making of integrated circuits. Over 300 process steps utilizing over 50 different types of process tools\nare required to make a single device like a microprocessor. Semiconductor chip manufacturers seek device performance benefits through new products and technology enhancements and productivity\nimprovements through increased throughput, equipment utilization and higher manufacturing yields. ",
        "        Capacity\nis added by increasing the amount of manufacturing equipment in existing fabrication facilities and by constructing new fabrication facilities. Periodically the semiconductor\ndevice industry adopts a larger silicon wafer size to achieve lower manufacturing costs. Semiconductor manufacturers can\nproduce more chips on a larger wafer, thus reducing the overall manufacturing cost per chip. For example, the use of 200mm wafers in production began at the end of the 1980s. The migration from 200mm\nto 300mm began at the end of the 1990s. The majority of wafer fabrication facilities today are using wafers with a diameter of 300mm. In 2015, Axcelis derived 87.0% of total systems revenue (a\ncomponent of product revenue) from sales of 300mm equipment. In 2011, industry participants began ",
        "2",
        " ",
        "planning\nfor the next wafer size transition, to 450mm diameter wafers. The schedule for this future transition will vary by customer, but is not anticipated before 2020. ",
        "        The\ncustomer base is also changing. Given the magnitude of the investment needed to build a new wafer fabrication facility (often referred to as a \"fab\"), which can be over\n$4.0 billion for a new 300mm fab, many customers are entering into partnerships to offset the cost of technology development and manufacturing. In addition, many chip developers outsource all\nor part of their chip manufacturing requirements to contract manufacturers, known as foundries. Foundries are significant purchasers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. ",
        "        The\nsemiconductor capital equipment industry is highly cyclical, as global chip production capacities successively exceed, then lag behind, global chip demand. When chip demand is high,\nand inventories low, chip manufacturers add capacity through capital equipment purchases. Given the difficulties of forecasting and calibrating chip demand and production capacity, the industry\nperiodically experiences excess chip inventories and softening chip prices. Device manufacturers react with muted capital spending, lowering the demand for capital equipment. Changes in consumer and\nbusiness demand for products in which chips are used also affect the industry. A successful semiconductor equipment manufacturer must not only provide some of the most technically complex products\nmanufactured in the world but also must design its business to thrive during the inevitable low points in the cycle. ",
        "        Our\nfinancial results in 2015 reflect our continued investment of a significant portion of our resources in research and development programs related to our leading edge Purion ion\nimplantation platform and the market introduction and sales of Purion H systems. These results also reflect our efforts to maintain tight control of discretionary spending. We expect customer demand\nfor our Purion products to continue to grow. ",

        "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIon Implantation Systems  ",
        "        Ion implantation is a principal step in the transistor formation cycle of the semiconductor manufacturing process. An ion implanter is\na large, technically advanced system that injects dopants such as arsenic, boron or phosphorus into a wafer. These dopants are ionized and therefore have electric charges. With an electric charge they\ncan be manipulated, moved and accelerated with electric and magnetic fields. Ion implanters use these fields to create a beam of ions with a precisely defined amount of energy (ranging between several\nhundred and three million electron-volts) and with a precisely defined amount of beam current (ranging from microamps to milliamps). Certain areas of the silicon wafer are blocked off by a polymer\nmaterial known as photoresist, which acts as a \"stencil\" to pattern devices so that the dopants will only enter the wafer where needed. The dopants change the electrical properties of the silicon\nwafer to create the active components of a chip, called the transistors. Typical process flows require twenty implant steps, with the most advanced processes requiring thirty or more. Each implant\nstep is characterized by four key parameters: dopant type, dose (amount of dopant), energy (depth into the silicon) and tilt (angle of wafer relative to the ion beam). ",
        "        In\norder to cover the wide range of implant steps, three different types of implanters have been developed, each designed to cover a specific range of applications, primarily defined by\ndose and energy. The three traditional implanter types are referred to as medium current, high current and high energy:",
        "\n\n• Medium current implanters are the original model of ion implanter, with mid to low-range energy and dose capability.  \n• High current implanters were the second type of implanter to emerge, having low energy capability and high dose range.  \n• High energy implanters emerged to address the need for deeper implants with a high energy range and low dose. \n",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Purion Platform and Family of Ion Implanters  ",
        "        Axcelis offers a complete line of high energy, high current and medium current implanters for all application requirements. Our\nflagship systems are all based on a common Purion platform which offers purity, precision and productivity by combining a high-speed, state-of-the-art single wafer end station, enabling unmatched\nthroughput (500 wafers per hour), and an advanced spot beam that ensures that all points across the wafer see the same beam at the same beam angle, resulting in exceptional process control and maximum\nyield.  ",
        "\n\n• High Energy\nImplant.  Our Purion XE high energy system, combines Axcelis' production-proven RF Linac high energy, spot beam technology with the\nPurion platform. Axcelis is a market leader in high energy ion implanters, and we expect to maintain our leadership in the high energy segment through sales of both our multi-wafer legacy high energy\nsystems and the Purion XE. In 2015, we secured three new customers for the Purion XE in six different fabrication facilities. We also introduced the Purion VXE, which offers a higher energy range.  \n• Medium Current\nImplant.  Our Purion M medium current system offers higher productivity and lower cost of ownership than competitive offerings, in\naddition to other advantages. Four customers, in both the memory and leading edge foundry segments, have the Purion M in production in 2015. We received follow-on orders from existing customers and\nobtained a new customer Purion M design-win. We also invested in technology that facilitates the manufacture of specialty devices on the Purion M, such as silicon carbide.   \n• High Current\nImplant.  Our Purion H high current system fulfills all traditional high current requirements while extending beyond traditional high\ncurrent energy and dose ranges. In order to maximize utilization and flexibility, the Purion H can process some traditional mid-current \n",

        "\n\n\nimplants.\nIn addition, the Purion H is extendable into ultra-low energy applications to satisfy future process requirements, including leakage current performance. We currently have four customers\nusing the Purion H in production, and in 2015 we received multiple orders from one leading edge memory customer. \n\n\n",
        "        We\nbelieve our ion implant products will continue to meet customer demand for advantages in productivity, process performance and technical extendibility. Our goal is to recapture ion\nimplant market share leadership by the end of 2017. ",

        "        In December 2012, Lam Research Corporation (\"Lam\") purchased the intellectual property rights relating to our dry strip systems\nbusiness. As a result of this transaction, we ceased the sale of 300mm dry strip wafer processing equipment in September 2013. In 2015, we and Lam agreed to extend the period of time in which we could\nsell dry strip systems for smaller wafers. Under the original agreement, our right to sell these systems ended in December 2015. As amended, we may continue to sell dry strip systems for 200mm and\n150mm wafers through December 2017,\nprovided royalties will be due to Lam on sales of 16 or more systems during the two year extension period. We will continue to service and support our dry strip installed base indefinitely. ",

        "\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview  ",
        "        The semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to significant cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor\nmanufacturers. Capital spending is influenced by\ndemand for semiconductors and the products using them, the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology, all of which are\noutside of our control. As a result, our revenue and gross margins fluctuate from year to year and period to period. Our established cost structure does not vary significantly with changes in volume.\nWe may experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenue as driven by the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers. ",
        "        A\nsuccessful semiconductor equipment manufacturer must not only provide some of the most technically complex products manufactured in the world but also must design its business to\nthrive during the inevitable low points in the cycle. Our financial results in 2015 reflect our investment of a significant portion of our resources in research and development programs related to our\nPurion ion implantation platform and the market introduction and initial sales of Purion systems. These results also reflect our efforts to maintain control of discretionary spending. ",
        "        In\n2014, we introduced the Purion H high current system. This system is critically important to the Company since it addresses the largest segment of the ion implant market, which\nrepresents 60% of the total $800 million to $1 billion ion implant market. We shipped seventeen Purion H high current ion implanters in 2015. We expect customer demands for our products\nto increase through 2016. Throughout 2016, we expect to continue to grow Purion system sales and improve gross margins while maintaining tight control of our cost structure, which we expect will yield\nimproved financial results throughout 2016. ",
        "        Consolidation\nand partnering within the semiconductor manufacturing industry has resulted in a smaller number of customers representing a substantial portion of our business. Our net\nrevenue from our ten largest customers accounted for 76.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 68.1% and 69.1% of revenue for the years ended December 31,\n2014 and 2013, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had two customers representing 29.3% and 10.5% of total revenue, respectively. ",
        "        Operating\nresults for the years presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future interim periods or years as a whole. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates  ",
        "        Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon Axcelis' consolidated\nfinancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with ",
        "19",
        " ",
        "accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Management's estimates are\nbased on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying\nvalues of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. ",
        "        We\nbelieve the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most significant judgments and\nestimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For additional accounting policies see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Recognition  ",
        "        Our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management. As described below, we consider a broad array of facts and\ncircumstances in determining when to recognize revenue, including contractual service obligations to the customer, the complexity of the customer's post-delivery acceptance provisions, payment\nhistory, customer creditworthiness and the installation process. In the future, if the post-delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower\nrate of acceptance, we may have to revise our revenue recognition policy, which could delay the timing of revenue recognition. ",
        "        Our\nsystem sales transactions are made up of multiple elements, including the system itself and elements that are not delivered simultaneously with the system. These undelivered elements\nmight include a combination of installation services, extended warranty and support and spare parts, all of which are generally covered by a single sales price. ",
        "        Our\nsystem revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has\nstand-alone value to the customer. If the criteria are met, then the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their relative selling price, and the revenue is recognized\nseparately for each of the separate units. ",
        "        We\ndetermine selling price for each unit of accounting (element) using vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\") or third-party evidence (\"TPE\"), if they exist, otherwise, we use best\nestimated selling price (\"BESP\"). We generally expect that we will not be able to establish TPE due to the nature of our products, and, as such, we typically will determine selling price using VSOE or\nBESP. ",
        "        Where\nrequired, we determine BESP for an individual element based on consideration of both market and Company-specific factors, including the selling price and profit margin for similar\nproducts, the cost to produce the deliverable and the anticipated margin on that deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold. ",
        "        Systems\nare not sold separately and VSOE or TPE is not available for the systems element. Therefore the selling price associated with systems is based on BESP. The allocated value for\ninstallation in the arrangement includes the greater of (i) the relative selling price of the installation or (ii) the portion of the sales price that will not be received until the\ninstallation is completed (the \"retention\"). The selling price of elements such as extended warranty for support, spare parts and support labor is also based on BESP. For the majority of regions, the\nselling price of installation is based upon the fair value of the service performed, including labor, which is based upon the estimated time to complete the installation at hourly rates, and material\ncomponents, both of which are sold separately, or VSOE. In regions where VSOE does not exist the Company uses BESP. ",
        "20",
        " ",
        "        Product\nrevenue for products which have demonstrated market acceptance, is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, evidence of an\narrangement exists, prices are contractually fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations, and there are no\nuncertainties regarding customer acceptance. Revenue from installation services is recognized at the time acceptance has occurred, as defined in the sales documentation, or, for certain customers,\nwhen both the acceptance has occurred and retention payment has been received. Revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed. ",
        "        We\ngenerally recognize product revenue for systems which have demonstrated market acceptance at the time of shipment because the customer's post-delivery acceptance provisions and\ninstallation process have been established to be routine, commercially inconsequential and perfunctory. We believe the risk of failure to complete a system installation is remote. ",
        "        For\ninitial shipments of systems with new technologies or in the small number of instances where we are unsure of meeting the customer's specifications or obtaining customer acceptance\nupon shipment of the system, we will defer the recognition of systems revenue and related costs until written customer acceptance of the system is obtained. This deferral period is generally within\ntwelve months of shipment. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets  ",
        "        We record impairment losses on long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that these assets might not be recoverable.\nRecoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets' carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured\nbased on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. ",
        "        Future\nactual performance could be materially different from our current forecasts, which could impact future estimates of undiscounted cash flows and may result in the impairment of the\ncarrying amount of the long-lived assets in the future. This could be caused by strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on\nour customer base or a material adverse change in our relationships with significant customers. ",
        "        We\ndid not record an impairment charge for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts Receivable—Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  ",
        "        We record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required\npayments. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a specific assessment of collectability of our customer accounts. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,\nresulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be necessary. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nInventory—Allowance for Excess and Obsolescence and Lower of Cost or Market  ",
        "        We record an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market. The allowance is determined using\nmanagement's assumptions of materials usage, based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by\nmanagement, additional inventory write-downs may be required. ",
        "        Although\nwe make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts or product demand and pricing assumptions, any significant unanticipated changes in demand, pricing, or technical\ndevelopments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results. In the future, if we determine that inventory needs to be written down, the Company will\nrecognize ",
        "21",
        " ",
        "such\ncosts in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination. If we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down, our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Warranty  ",
        "        We generally offer a one year warranty for all of our systems, the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold.\nFor all systems sold, we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the relative fair value\nof non-standard warranty. Costs for non-standard warranty are expensed as incurred. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated product\nfailure rates, material usage and service labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nShare-Based Compensation  ",
        "        Stock-based compensation expense with time-based conditions is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and\nis recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period, based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. Estimating the fair value for stock\noptions requires judgment, including the expected term of our stock options, volatility of our stock, expected dividends, risk-free interest rates over the expected term of the options and the\nexpected forfeiture rate. ",
        "        We\nare responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors when estimating volatility. Our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options\ngranted relies on a combination of historical and implied volatility. We believe that this blended volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options\nbecause it more appropriately reflects the market's current expectations of future volatility. ",
        "        In\nlimited circumstances, we also issue stock option grants with vesting based on performance or market conditions, such as the price of our common stock, or, a combination of time or\nmarket conditions. The fair values and derived service periods for all grants that have vesting based on market conditions are estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method. For each stock option\ngrant with vesting based on a combination of time or market conditions, where vesting will occur if either condition is met, the related compensation costs are recognized over the shorter of the\nexplicit service period or the derived service period. ",
        "        We\nuse the straight-line attribution method to recognize expense for stock-based awards such that the expense associated with awards is evenly recognized throughout the period. ",
        "        The\namount of stock-based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant\nand revise them, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term \"forfeitures\" is distinct from \"cancellations\" or \"expirations\" and represents only the\nunvested portion of the surrendered stock-based award. ",
        "        The\nbenefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost is reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. Because the Company does not\nrecognize the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost due to its cumulative net operating loss position, this had no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of cash\nflows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes  ",
        "        We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future\ntax consequences attributable to differences between the ",

        "financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. ",
        "        Our\nconsolidated financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses, as well as other temporary differences between\nfinancial and income tax accounting. ",
        "        We\nestablish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant management judgment is required\nin determining our provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against those net deferred tax assets. ",
        "        We\nevaluate the weight of all available evidence such as historical losses, projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences to\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized. ",
        "        Based\non our level of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and our level of historical U.S. losses, we have determined that the current uncertainty regarding the\nrealization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the need for a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets. We have also determined that a valuation allowance is required on\na portion of our foreign deferred tax assets. ",
        "        Our\nincome tax expense includes the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of\nthe tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change\nto the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expense. ",

        "\n\n\n\n\n\nA significant portion of our revenue depends on customers electing to buy aftermarket products and\nservices from Axcelis  ",
        "        Historically, a significant portion of our product revenue and all of our service revenue relates to our sale of \"aftermarket\" products\nand services, which include parts, consumables, upgrades, service contracts, and time and materials billings. Some of our customers purchase less aftermarket products and services, often training\ntheir own staff to maintain and service semiconductor equipment rather than relying on the equipment manufacturer for these services. In addition, we compete against third party parts suppliers for\nthe sale of parts and consumables that are not protected by patents or otherwise proprietary. To the extent our customers purchase parts and services from other vendors or provide their own system\nmaintenance labor, our revenue will be less. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nOur financial results may fluctuate significantly.  ",
        "        We derive our new systems revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of expensive products to a small number of customers. The\nlist prices on our ion implant systems range from $1.8 million to $5.5 million. We also sell used equipment in our aftermarket business. At our current sales level, each sale, or failure\nto make a sale, has a significant effect on us in a particular quarter. In a given quarter, a number of factors can adversely affect our revenue and results, including changes in our product mix,\nincreased fixed expenses per unit due to reductions in the number of products manufactured, and higher fixed costs due to increased levels of research and development and expansion of our worldwide\nsales and marketing organization. Our financial results also fluctuate based on gross profit realized on sales. A variety of factors may cause gross profit as a percentage of revenue to vary,\nincluding the mix and average selling prices of products sold, costs to manufacture and customize systems, warranty costs and impact of changes to inventory reserves. New product introductions may\nalso affect our gross margins. Fluctuations in our financial results may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. ",
        "\n\n\n\n\n\nOur financial results may fall short of anticipated levels because forecasting revenue and\nprofitability is complex and may be inaccurate.  ",
        "        Management may from time to time provide financial forecasts. These forecasts are based on assumptions which are believed to be\nreasonable when made, of fab utilization, shipment timing and system acceptance timing. Any of these assumptions can prove erroneous and the level of revenue recognizable in a particular quarter may\nvary from the forecast. Our lengthy sales cycle, coupled with customers' competing capital budget considerations, make the timing of customer orders difficult to predict. In addition, our backlog at\nthe beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter and is not a reliable indicator of our future sales. As a result, our revenue\nand operating results for a quarter depend on our shipping orders as scheduled during that quarter, receiving customer acceptance of previously shipped products, and obtaining new orders for products\nto be shipped in that same quarter. Any delay in, or cancellation of, scheduled shipments and customer acceptances or in shipments from new orders could materially affect our financial results. ",
        "        New\naccounting rules addressing revenue recognition have added more complexity in forecasting quarterly revenue and profitability. Orders for our products usually contain multiple\ndelivery elements that result in revenue deferral under generally accepted accounting principles. Due to the foregoing factors, investors should understand that our actual financial results for a\nquarter may vary significantly from our forecasts of financial performance for that quarter. Failure to meet forecasted financial performance may have an adverse effect on the price of our common\nstock. ",

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to\nsatisfy our anticipated cash requirements. A number of factors, including those described in these \"Risk Factors,\" could prove our assumptions wrong and cause us to require additional capital from\nexternal sources. Depending on market conditions, future debt or equity financings may not be possible on attractive terms or at all. In addition, future debt or equity financings could be dilutive to\nthe existing holders of our common stock. ",

        "        The semiconductor business is highly cyclical, experiencing upturns when the demand for our products is high and downturns when our\ncustomers are not investing in new or expanded fabrication facilities. From time to time, inventory buildups in the semiconductor industry, resulting in part from periodic downturns, produce an\noversupply of semiconductors. This can cause semiconductor manufacturers to revise capital spending plans, resulting in reduced demand for capital equipment such as our products. If an oversupply is\nnot reduced by increasing demand from the various industries that use semiconductors, which we cannot accurately predict, our sales and profitability will be harmed. Our revenue can vary significantly\nfrom one point in the cycle to another, making it difficult to manage the business, both when revenue is increasing and when it is decreasing. In addition, a substantial portion of our operating\nexpenses do not fluctuate with changes in volume. Significant decreases in revenue can therefore have a disproportionate effect on profitability.

        "        The market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is highly competitive and includes some companies with substantially greater\nfinancial, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support resources than we have that may be better positioned to compete successfully in the industry. In addition, there are\nsmaller, emerging semiconductor equipment companies that could provide innovative systems with technology that may have performance advantages over our systems. We expect our competitors to continue\nto improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics. If we are unable to\nimprove or introduce competing products when demanded by the markets, our business will be harmed. Finally, if we must lower prices to remain competitive without commensurate cost of goods savings,\nour gross margins and profitability will be adversely affected. ",

For example, in 2015, our top ten customers accounted for 76.8% of our net sales, in comparison to 68.1% and 89.1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. None of our customers has entered into a\nlong-term agreement requiring it to purchase our products. Although the composition of the group comprising our largest customers has varied from year to year, the loss of a significant customer or\nany reduction or delays in orders from any significant customer could adversely affect us.

We obtain\nmany of these components and sub-assemblies from a limited group of suppliers. Accordingly, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components on a timely basis, on price and other\nterms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, we often quote prices to our customers and accept customer orders for our products\nbefore purchasing components and sub-assemblies from our suppliers. If our suppliers increase the cost of components or sub-assemblies, we may not have alternative sources of supply and may not be\nable to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of components, negatively impacting our gross margins.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 24.7% of our revenue was derived from foreign operations with this inherent risk. In addition, at\nDecember 31, 2015, our operations outside of the United States accounted for approximately 20.7% of our total assets, the majority of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar.
